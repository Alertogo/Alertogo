# About Alertogo

Alertogo is a platform for finding the best deals on different goods and services.

The increase in population combined with the scarcity of apartments available on the market, the price of rents has skyrocketed in Quebec in recent years.
With the aim of helping housing seekers find an apartment that suits them at a better, reasonable price, we have created a search engine that scans the web, extracts the best apartments available on the market and offers them to you.

The Alertogo apartment search platform brings together rental ads published on different websites in a single, simple and easy-to-use platform. An interactive map can be used to see the location of the apartments.

# Social impact

One of the pillars of our mission is to contribute positively to our community in order to make housing even more accessible to all.
If you think we could help you with your mission, contact us to discuss your ideas. We will be happy to help you and see if we can contribute.
